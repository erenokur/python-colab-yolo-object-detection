# python-colab-yolo-object-detection

This project created on 2021 for one of my master lectures.

Project uses Yolo V3 on the google colab.

Before running main.py;

You need to label a training set of images. I made a helper script to rename pictures before labbelling process.

After labelling complated process.py need to be run in order to create weights. 

After weights created main.py can identify given images.
